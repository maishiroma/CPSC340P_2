# cpsc344Project
This contains the Unity files needed in order to make our game. 

## In order to send the files you worked on to this repository, go to the folder where you cloned this project and in the folder that has the work you did, do the following:
- git add -A (-A means add everything. You can upload a specific file or folder too like Script1.cs, texture1.png, Music/ instead of doing -A)
- git commit -m "description of what you edited" (This adds a change description to all of the files you added so far.)
- git push -u origin master (You only need to do this once you're done adding/commiting all of the files you've edited)

## And to update the copy you have, just go to the directory that's created when you first cloned this and do:
- git pull
